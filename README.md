# ms-band-smartthings-tile
Simple tile that allows you to select a set of SmartThings switches to display and toggle on/off from your Microsoft Band.

Currently for Android phones (and in development for UWP) this tile allows you to select up to 8 SmartThings switches and swipe through them on your Microsoft Band, turning them on/off without picking up your phone.
