{"name":"Microsoft Band + SmartThings = ðŸ’¡","tagline":"Android tile that allows you to select a set of SmartThings switches to display and turn on/off from your Microsoft Band.","body":"### Microsoft Band + SmartThings tile\r\nCurrently only for Android phones, this tile allows you to select up to 8 [SmartThings](smartthings.com) switches and swipe through them on your [Microsoft Band](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-band/en-us), turning them on/off without picking up your phone.\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\nYou'll need to [create a smart app](http://docs.smartthings.com/en/latest/getting-started/first-smartapp.html) on SmartThings using [the Groovy code in the SmartThings folder](https://github.com/abethcrane/ms-band-smartthings-tile/blob/master/smartthings/toggleswitches.groovy). Install the app to your hub (selecting up to 8 switches). This is only required once, and the app will continue to run even after leaving the page.\r\n\r\n![What the smart app page should look like after it's installed and running](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abethcrane/ms-band-smartthings-tile/master/images/smartthings%20app.png).\r\n\r\nOnce this is done, take the API token and API endpoint and insert them into the [Helpers.java](https://github.com/abethcrane/ms-band-smartthings-tile/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/beth/smartthings_msband/Helpers.java) file (lines 30 and 31). \r\n\r\n![The lines to edit in Helpers.java](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abethcrane/ms-band-smartthings-tile/master/images/Helpers%20java.png).\r\n\r\nHaving done that, you're ready to [build the android project](http://developer.android.com/tools/building/building-studio.html), and install it to your phone.\r\n\r\nOpen the app, and press the \"Update tile/sync data\" button to install the tile on your band and sync down your settings data.\r\n\r\nThe app does require the Microsoft Health app to be installed and set up with your Microsoft Band, as all tiles do.\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abethcrane/ms-band-smartthings-tile/master/images/Tile.jpg\" width=\"40%\" alt=\"The tile's icon on your band\" align=\"center\" />&nbsp;<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abethcrane/ms-band-smartthings-tile/master/images/Tile2.jpg\" width=\"40%\" alt=\"What the tile looks like once it's installed\" align=\"center\"/></center>\r\n\r\n### Languages\r\nThis project was written using Android + the Microsoft Band SDK, and Groovy + the SmartThings SDK.\r\n\r\n### Issues\r\nIf you run into any issues please do reach out. Pull requests with fixes/features are more than welcome.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@abethcrane wrote this from late 2015-early 2016 in order to familiarize herself with the MS band / SmartThings SDK's.
